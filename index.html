    <h3>Who is Drake?</h3>
    <p><strong><em>Aubrey Drake Graham</em></strong>, known professionally as <strong>Drake</strong>, is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, and actor. An influential figure in contemporary popular music, Drake has been credited with popularizing singing and R&B sensibilities in hip hop artists. Gaining recognition by starring as Jimmy Brooks in the CTV teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation (2001–08), he pursued a recording career in 2006, releasing his debut mixtape Room for Improvement in February of that year. He followed up with the mixtapes Comeback Season (2007) and So Far Gone (2009) before signing with Young Money Entertainment.</p>

    <p>Each of Drake's albums have topped the US Billboard 200 and Canadian Albums Chart; his first three, Thank Me Later (2010), Take Care (2011) and Nothing Was the Same (2013) were met with critical and commercial success, propelling him to the forefront of hip hop.[5] His fourth album, Views (2016), saw exploration of dancehall and stood atop the Billboard 200 for 13 non-consecutive weeks—making it the first album by a male artist to do so in over a decade—and featured the international hit singles "Hotline Bling" and "One Dance" (featuring WizKid and Kyla); the latter has been credited with helping the popularization of the dancehall and Afrobeats genres in contemporary pop music.[6][7] In 2018, Drake released the double album Scorpion, which contained the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "God's Plan", "Nice for What", and "In My Feelings".[8] Drake's sixth album, Certified Lover Boy (2021), achieved nine top 10 hits on the Hot 100, briefly setting the record for most US top-ten hits from one album, with its lead single "Way 2 Sexy" (featuring Future and Young Thug) reaching number one.[9] In 2022, Drake released the house-inspired album Honestly, Nevermind and the collaborative album, Her Loss, with 21 Savage. His eighth album, For All the Dogs (2023) yielded the number-one singles "Slime You Out" (featuring SZA) and "First Person Shooter" (featuring J. Cole), with which he tied Michael Jackson for the most number-one singles by a male solo artist.[10] Known for frequent accompanying releases to his albums, Drake achieved critical and commercial success with the mixtapes If You're Reading This It's Too Late (2015) and More Life (2017).</p>
